# Firebase Realtime Database Asynchronous Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with asynchronous data updates in Firebase's Realtime Database and its interaction with the `onValue` listener. The bug showcases how the asynchronous nature of database operations can lead to missed updates, resulting in the application not reflecting the latest data immediately.

## Bug Description
The core problem is the use of a randomly generated ID combined with the inherent asynchronicity of Firebase operations. The `onValue` listener might not immediately detect the newly added data due to the timing of events.  This repository provides a clear example of this asynchronous issue and its solution.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Firebase modules: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure your Firebase project with the appropriate credentials.
4. Run `node bug.js`. 
5. Observe that sometimes the newly added data is not immediately reflected in the app. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution which involves using a transaction or `once` to ensure the updated data is read and processed correctly.
