In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating in real-time, even though I was using the `onValue` listener.  The issue turned out to be a subtle error in my data structure. I was adding a new item to my Firebase database as an object with a randomly generated ID.  However, due to asynchronous operations, the `onValue` listener occasionally missed the initial update. This meant my app didn't reflect the latest data immediately after addition.
